Instructions
You will be playing a classic game of TIC-TAC-TOE against an opponent (the computer). But what is tic-tac-toe?
The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
You and your opponent will take turns putting a mark in an empty square in the grid.
Your mark will be represented with an 'X', while your opponent's mark will be an 'O'.
You win by being the first one to get 3 marks in a line (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally).
If no one is able to achieve this, the game ends in a tie.
